This is the project 1 skeleton, version 3 (2/26/2014).

Bug fixes:
- Fig bug in run-sec-tests reported by Nikita Kouevda (@293).
- Added functionality test tricky.jpg, added valgrind suppression
  file.
- Add flag for suppressions to run-sec-tests, for people who
  don't realize they need to copy over the .valgrindrc file too.
